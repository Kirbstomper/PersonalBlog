title: The creation of this blog and why (TODO)

For the longest time as a developer I have wrestled with having personal blog
I have used stuff such as blogspot, to host one, but it seems like every developer
worth their salt has a personal site built and hosted by them, no matter how shitty it is.

My constraints are that I don't want to pay a lot of money for hosting so I plan
to run it on one of my home server machines, most likely on a raspberry pi 4. AS I work on it I will
edit this file, but before actually deploying I will clean things up. At least that's the plan or else
you will get stream of conciousness writing.


I picked go because it has a few key features, running on a lot of things, being fast enough, and having
everything I need to build this blog as a part of the standard library. I do Java for the most part in my day job
as a Team Lead at AHEAD, but the flexability and power of just plain ole Go without having to bring in 
entire libraries or frameworks is great. Modern Java and Spring are basically synonomous at this point and while
spring is an amazing framework I love to work in, it just feels nice building something from abstracted scratch

The idea for the blog is to write blog posts such as this in yaml, then using templates,
generate the actual HTML pages and store them on disk at startup to save on actual processing time.

I want the blog to be simple with the following design in mind:

 at the index display about me, with a link to the latest post
 for each post have a link to the post before and if not the latest post, the post after
 Posts in chronological order based on the date field
 have a page that simply lists in order of latest to oldest all my posts

 With some idea of a design down and the repo initiated the first thing to do before pounding my keyboard and 
 getting this thing going is to have some form of CI running to make sure that commits I make either to articles or
 to code does not break the build in anyway. Any commit I make should be able to build the site without trouble.

 As for actual CD. For now it makes sense to host the site on github pages. 
 This is planned to be a static site so should github begin charging for pages or doing
 something I don't agree with, I can easily move hosts or even host it myself like I planned from the offset.
